					theft, fraud and other potentially illegal acts; correlate
					related or multiple accounts to prevent abuse of our
					services; and to facilitate joint or co - branded services

					or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is
					reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms or Privacy
					Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or
					other content violates the rights of a third party; or
					protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users

					policy with respect to your personal information.

					requirements.) Upon request for account closure, your
					account will be closed but this closure will not involve
					deletion of historical records of the account for the
					reasons already stated. However, except as may be required
					by law or law enforcement agents and/or regulators, further
					processing of the personal information related to the
					account will cease from time of closure.

					information is in our possession we adhere to strict
					security guidelines, protecting it against unauthorized
					access. However, please bear in mind that we cannot
					guarantee that the internet in itself is 100% secure and so

					information, transmission of personal information to and
					from our services is at your own risk. You should only
